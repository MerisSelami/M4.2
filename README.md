There is no build process required. You can view the site in two simple ways:

Option 1: Open directly

Download or clone this repository.

Locate the index.html file.

Double-click index.html (or right-click -> Open With -> choose your browser).

The site will open in your default browser.

Option 2: Use Live Server (recommended)

Open the project folder in VS Code.

Install the Live Server extension.

Right-click index.html and choose “Open with Live Server.”

This will launch the site at http://localhost:5500 (or another port) and automatically reload the page as you make changes.
